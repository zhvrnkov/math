# math
Learning math with some python.

There're also some my desmos sandboxes, which I've done during learning
- [bezier path equation](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/imuhttef6p)
- [tangent line to any curve equation](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/eectb1rhi4)
- [cubic polynomial to fit 4 points](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/snl95gtxew)

> **Note**: the main condition for writing this sandboxes were that I'll find solution on my own and only then check "proper" solutions and sources for simpler and more elegant approaches
